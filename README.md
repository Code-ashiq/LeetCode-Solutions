# LeetCode Solutions 🧠

A collection of my solutions to LeetCode problems, organized by topic and difficulty. This repository is part of my learning journey in data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving for technical interviews.

## 📌 About

This repo includes:

- ✅ **Clean and optimized code** for each problem
- 🧪 Solutions primarily in **Python**
- 📂 Folder structure organized by **problem category**
- 📚 Regular updates as I solve more problems

The goal is to make this repository a **useful reference** for others preparing for interviews.
